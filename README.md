# Blastocyst_Gardner_Classification

Manual grading of day-4 and day-5 human blastocysts by embryologists is subjective, prone to lab bias and require highly trained doctors. Machine classification
is limited by small and unbalanced datasets due to the nature of the subject. We
propose an end-to-end pipeline combining real-image classifiers, synthetic image generation, and explainability to improve grading consistency and downstream viability
prediction. Key components include benchmarking against existing deep-learning baselines, exploring multiple generative approaches, and rigorous quantitative evaluation.
